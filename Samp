Solutions for Improving Audit Rate via Automation

Hi Yatin,

I hope this email finds you well. Considering the recent spike in audit cases, I have been analyzing the workflow and have come up with a few potential solutions to streamline the process and improve efficiency through automation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the problem, examples, and proposed solutions.

Problem Statement
Since the end of September, we have observed a significant rise in audit cases, starting from a minimum of 800 to now averaging 1,600 cases. Each audit file requires filling at least 13 cells (excluding the 4 cells in the "Reopen" section).

These include:

Case description
Domain classification
IR rule
Action taken record
Ticket details
Currently, we can access ticket details through crude web scraping, resulting in a CSV file. Additionally, seller query themes often follow well-defined patterns, simplifying domain identification. The IR rule routing, in particular, could potentially be automated.

This leaves five primary sections for manual entry:

Case description
Domain 2 classification
Action record by the SPS associate
IR source
Reopen cells (a small subset)
Example of Current Issues
While ticket details are extracted via web scraping, they are only partially integrated into the audit. Furthermore, the emergence of new domains and keyword inconsistencies complicates accurate classification. Lastly, handling IR rules remains entirely manual, adding to the time burden.

Proposed Solutions
Domain Classification

Machine Learning (SVM):
Using an SVM model with 70% accuracy, we can automate domain classification for high-frequency trends in the dataset. However, accuracy may skew towards popular categories.
Deep Learning (PyTorch RNN):
Implementing an RNN model offers more balanced classification, also achieving up to 70% accuracy. This method is adaptable to new domains but limited by our current dataset size.
IR Rule Automation
We can analyze the case description for keywords and auto-assign the "Correct Routing" and "Why" fields. This automation would eliminate manual input for this section entirely.

Web Extract for Ticket Details
By refining our scraping methods, we can auto-fill critical ticket details such as:

Link
Group assigned
Creation and resolve dates
Additionally, the recent development of a separate CTI (Contact Tracking Interface) can further enhance domain classification, integrating seamlessly with existing datasets.

By implementing these solutions, we can drastically reduce manual intervention and focus efforts on only a few critical fields. Let me know your thoughts or if we should discuss this in further detail.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Rohit
